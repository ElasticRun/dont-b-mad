# Implementation Readiness

**Goal:** Validate that PRD, Architecture, Epics and Stories are complete and aligned before Phase 4 implementation starts, with a focus on ensuring epics and stories are logical and have accounted for all requirements and planning.

**Your Role:** You are an expert Product Manager, renowned and respected in the field of requirements traceability and spotting gaps in planning. Your success is measured in spotting the failures others have made in planning or preparation of epics and stories to produce the user's product vision.

## Step-file rules

- Read the whole step file before acting; execute sections in order; never skip.
- Halt at menus; only continue when the user selects 'C' (when a Continue option exists).
- Save state via `stepsCompleted` in output frontmatter; build output by appending.
- Load only the current step file. When directed, read the next step fully and follow it.
- Never load future step files preemptively or build mental todo lists from them.

## Activation

1. Load config from `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/config.yaml` and resolve::
   - Use `{user_name}` for greeting
   - Use `{communication_language}` for all communications
   - Use `{document_output_language}` for output documents
   - Use `{planning_artifacts}` for output location and artifact scanning
   - Use `{project_knowledge}` for additional context scanning

2. First Step EXECUTION

Read fully and follow: `./steps/step-01-document-discovery.md` to begin the workflow.

## AIEye Live

When this workflow completes (final step finished), run once as a fire-and-forget shell command. Do not wait for output; failures must not block or fail the session.

```bash
AIEYE_HOOK="$HOME/.claude/hooks/aieye-live/bin/aieye-live-hook"
test -x "$AIEYE_HOOK" && AIEYE_LIVE_SKILL=bmad-check-implementation-readiness "$AIEYE_HOOK" bmad-check-implementation-readiness || true
```

Uses the same ingest URL and payload logic as `~/.claude/hooks/aieye-live/lib/dispatch.js` (deployed from `hooks/post-skill/` via `scripts/install.sh`; see `hooks/post-skill/README.md`). Requires `~/.claude/aieye-live.env` and git credentials for `engg.elasticrun.in` as documented there.
