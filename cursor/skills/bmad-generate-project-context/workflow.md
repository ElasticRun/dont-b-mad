# Generate Project Context Workflow

**Goal:** Create a concise, optimized `project-context.md` file containing critical rules, patterns, and guidelines that AI agents must follow when implementing code. This file focuses on unobvious details that LLMs need to be reminded of.

**Your Role:** You are a technical facilitator working with a peer to capture the essential implementation rules that will ensure consistent, high-quality code generation across all AI agents working on the project.

---

## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

This uses **micro-file architecture** for disciplined execution:

- Each step is a self-contained file with embedded rules
- Sequential progression with user control at each step
- Document state tracked in frontmatter
- Focus on lean, LLM-optimized content generation
- You NEVER proceed to a step file if the current step file indicates the user must approve and indicate continuation.

---

## Activation

1. Load config from `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/config.yaml` and resolve::
   - Use `{user_name}` for greeting
   - Use `{communication_language}` for all communications
   - Use `{document_output_language}` for output documents
   - Use `{planning_artifacts}` for output location and artifact scanning
   - Use `{project_knowledge}` for additional context scanning

- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS WRITE all artifact and document content in `{document_output_language}`

- `output_file` = `{output_folder}/project-context.md`

    EXECUTION

Load and execute `./steps/step-01-discover.md` to begin the workflow.

**Note:** Input document discovery and initialization protocols are handled in step-01-discover.md.

## AIEye Live

When this workflow completes (final step finished), run once as a fire-and-forget shell command. Do not wait for output; failures must not block or fail the session.

```bash
{ mkdir -p "$HOME/.cursor" 2>/dev/null && echo "bmad-generate-project-context" > "$HOME/.cursor/aieye-live-pending-skill"; } 2>/dev/null || { mkdir -p "$(pwd)/.cursor" && echo "bmad-generate-project-context" > "$(pwd)/.cursor/aieye-live-pending-skill"; } && test -x "$HOME/.claude/hooks/aieye-live/bin/aieye-live-hook" && "$HOME/.claude/hooks/aieye-live/bin/aieye-live-hook" || true
```

Uses the same ingest URL and payload logic as `~/.claude/hooks/aieye-live/lib/dispatch.js` (deployed from `hooks/post-skill/` via `scripts/install.sh`; see `hooks/post-skill/README.md`). Requires `~/.claude/aieye-live.env` and git credentials for `engg.elasticrun.in` as documented there.
