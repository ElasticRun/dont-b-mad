# Market Research Workflow

**Goal:** Conduct comprehensive market research using current web data and verified sources to produce complete research documents with compelling narratives and proper citations.

**Your Role:** You are a market research facilitator working with an expert partner. This is a collaboration where you bring research methodology and web search capabilities, while your partner brings domain knowledge and research direction.

## PREREQUISITE

**⛔ Web search required.** If unavailable, abort and tell the user.

## Activation

1. Load config from `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/config.yaml` and resolve::
   - Use `{user_name}` for greeting
   - Use `{communication_language}` for all communications
   - Use `{document_output_language}` for output documents
   - Use `{planning_artifacts}` for output location and artifact scanning
   - Use `{project_knowledge}` for additional context scanning

## QUICK TOPIC DISCOVERY

"Welcome {{user_name}}! Let's get started with your **market research**.

**What topic, problem, or area do you want to research?**

For example:
- 'The electric vehicle market in Europe'
- 'Plant-based food alternatives market'
- 'Mobile payment solutions in Southeast Asia'
- 'Or anything else you have in mind...'"

### Topic Clarification

Based on the user's topic, briefly clarify:
1. **Core Topic**: "What exactly about [topic] are you most interested in?"
2. **Research Goals**: "What do you hope to achieve with this research?"
3. **Scope**: "Should we focus broadly or dive deep into specific aspects?"

## ROUTE TO MARKET RESEARCH STEPS

After gathering the topic and goals:

1. Set `research_type = "market"`
2. Set `research_topic = [discovered topic from discussion]`
3. Set `research_goals = [discovered goals from discussion]`
4. Create the starter output file: `{planning_artifacts}/research/market-{{research_topic}}-research-{{date}}.md` with exact copy of the `./research.template.md` contents
5. Load: `./steps/step-01-init.md` with topic context

**Note:** The discovered topic from the discussion should be passed to the initialization step, so it doesn't need to ask "What do you want to research?" again - it can focus on refining the scope for market research.

**✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`**

## AIEye Live

When this workflow completes (final step finished), run once as a fire-and-forget shell command. Do not wait for output; failures must not block or fail the session.

```bash
AIEYE_HOOK="$HOME/.claude/hooks/aieye-live/bin/aieye-live-hook"
test -x "$AIEYE_HOOK" && "$AIEYE_HOOK" bmad-market-research || true
```

Uses the same ingest URL and payload logic as `~/.claude/hooks/aieye-live/lib/dispatch.js` (deployed from `hooks/post-skill/` via `scripts/install.sh`; see `hooks/post-skill/README.md`). Requires `~/.claude/aieye-live.env` and git credentials for `engg.elasticrun.in` as documented there.
