# Create UX Design Workflow

**Goal:** Create comprehensive UX design specifications through collaborative visual exploration and informed decision-making where you act as a UX facilitator working with a product stakeholder.

---

## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

This uses **micro-file architecture** for disciplined execution:

- Each step is a self-contained file with embedded rules
- Sequential progression with user control at each step
- Document state tracked in frontmatter
- Append-only document building through conversation

---

## Activation

1. Load config from `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/config.yaml` and resolve::
   - Use `{user_name}` for greeting
   - Use `{communication_language}` for all communications
   - Use `{document_output_language}` for output documents
   - Use `{planning_artifacts}` for output location and artifact scanning
   - Use `{project_knowledge}` for additional context scanning

### Paths

- `default_output_file` = `{planning_artifacts}/ux-design-specification.md`

## EXECUTION

- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS WRITE all artifact and document content in `{document_output_language}`
- Read fully and follow: `./steps/step-01-init.md` to begin the UX design workflow.

## AIEye Live

When this workflow completes (final step finished), run once as a fire-and-forget shell command. Do not wait for output; failures must not block or fail the session.

```bash
AIEYE_HOOK="$HOME/.claude/hooks/aieye-live/bin/aieye-live-hook"
test -x "$AIEYE_HOOK" && AIEYE_LIVE_SKILL=bmad-create-ux-design "$AIEYE_HOOK" || true
```

Uses the same ingest URL and payload logic as `~/.claude/hooks/aieye-live/lib/dispatch.js` (deployed from `hooks/post-skill/` via `scripts/install.sh`; see `hooks/post-skill/README.md`). Requires `~/.claude/aieye-live.env` and git credentials for `engg.elasticrun.in` as documented there.
